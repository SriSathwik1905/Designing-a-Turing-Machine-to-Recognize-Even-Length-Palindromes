# Turing Machine for Even-Length Palindrome Recognition

This project implements a Turing Machine to recognize and accept even-length palindromes. An even-length palindrome is a string of symbols that reads the same forwards and backwards with an even number of characters, such as "abba" or "baab." This Turing Machine, created using **JFLAP 7.1**, processes input strings of 'a' and 'b' to determine if they match the criteria of an even-length palindrome.

## Project Details

- **Software**: JFLAP 7.1
- **Objective**: To design a Turing Machine that can recognize even-length palindromes, illustrating how Turing Machines can solve complex language recognition tasks.
- **Input Alphabet**: `{a, b}`
- **Acceptance Condition**: The machine halts in an accepting state if the input string is an even-length palindrome.

## Repository Contents

- **JFLAP File**: The `.jff` file representing the Turing Machine designed in JFLAP 7.1.
- **Documentation**: A report detailing the objectives, design process, and functionality of the Turing Machine.
- **Sample Inputs**: Test cases used to validate the functionality of the Turing Machine, demonstrating both accepted and rejected strings.

## Usage

To use the Turing Machine, open the `.jff` file in JFLAP 7.1 and input test strings to simulate the machine's operation. The machine will accept strings that are even-length palindromes and reject all others.
